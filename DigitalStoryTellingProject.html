 <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Time Management & Prioritization</h3>
    <p>The time management and prioritization lesson was extremely helpful for me for many reasons. Although the task of planning an entire month to the hour seemed really daunting at first, it proved to actually be quite manageable because I found patterns in my assignment due dates and my own person schedule, so my weeks were quite routine. Doing this assignment made me feel significantly less stressed about my assignments and extracurriculars because when I just have a bunch of due dates thrown at me, it seems like more than I can handle. However, after planning them all out, it showed me that they actually were manageable and that I had more than enough time to complete them. I also think that this lesson came at the perfect time in the semester because it was right when I started to have assessments in my classes and the difficulty of assignments started increasing.

      <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Introduction to Career Exploration</h3>
    <p>Coming into college quite unsure of what I want to after graduation, as many college students do, I found the introduction to career exploration lesson to be really meaningful to me. First of all, it was very important that I learn about the career services Northeastern offers and their websites. I now know where to look when I am in need of a job or I want to search for a co-op. I also know where to go and who to talk to when I want someone to look over my resume or if I have a question about co-op. On the mention of resumes, I really appreciated the resume workshop that we did in class. I believe that I now have a solid understanding of what a computer science resume should look like and what features it should and should not have. Looking at samples resumes and having a classmate peer review my resume was also super helpful, and now I have a great starting point for my resume.

      <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Advising 101</h3>
    <p>I think the advising 101 lesson was super important because it made me feel a lot more calm about the process of scheduling classes, which is something that is normally really stress inducing for students. Watching the videos about how to make plans and then register for the classes in your plan was very useful because when it came time to actually register for my classes, I knew what to do and I was able to get it done quickly and easily, and get my first choice of classes. I also liked how the lesson including what to do if a problem were to arise while scheduling because registering for classes is already stressful, and running into a problem and not know what to do only makes it more stressful. Finally, I really liked how we had to make sample plans for homework a week before registration actually opened because it forced me to think about what I wanted my schedule to look like for next semester and gave me ample time to do so. It was also nice to have backup plans in case some of my first choice classes got filled.

 <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Neighborhood Matters: A Screening of <i>Three Thousand Years Plus Life</i></h3>
    <p>The first passport series event that I went to satisfied the culture and diversity and/or social justice requirement, and it was a screening of a documentary called Three Thousand Years Plus Life. The documentary highlighted the misuse of correctional authority in correctional institutions across New England as well as the Walpole prison takeover in 1973. Something that I found really interesting was how before new technologies such as smartphones and streaming services, people used films to mobilize for social change. A group of people would get together and watch a documentary about a topic that needed reform and subsequently take steps to do so. However, now that there are streaming services and fast paced news updates on smartphones, people organize in other ways, such as through the use of social media.

      <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Introduction to GitHub Workshop</h3>
    <p>This was my favorite passport series event because I think it was the most useful. I had always heard of GitHub and knew that knowing how to use it’s important for computer science related jobs, but I did not have much experience using it, nor did I even know where to start. I think the workshop was a great introduction to what GitHub is, why it’s important, and how to use it. It was really interesting to learn how to use terminal because that was also something that I had minimal experience with but wanted to learn more about how to use. In fact, I enjoyed the workshop so much that I am using GitHub to create this website. I am excited to learn more about how to use it, but for now I believe that I have a great understanding of the basics, which is very important to me.

      <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Dialogue of Civilizations Fair</h3>
    <p>Going to the Dialogue of Civilizations Fair was really fun and also really informative. The first dialogue that I looked at was a textile and coding one in Austria, which seemed really cool because it combined coding with art, and although art is not my strongest skill, it sounded super fun to combine what I am studying with something that is challenging for me. The next dialogue that I looked at was a Spanish language and culture one in Spain, because I really loved Spanish in high school and I really want to travel to Spain. Finally, I looked at the new CCIS dialogue in Germany, which also sounded really interesting. It was really cool to talk to students who had been on the dialogues and really enjoyed them.

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Advice for Future NU Students</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">

 <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Start Assignments Early & Go to Office Hours</h3>
    <p>I’m sure this advice is the most popular to give to incoming college students, and I know that I, myself, have heard it a hundred times, but it’s really, really important. Starting your work early is really important for a few reasons. First of all, it will make you feel a lot more relaxed because cramming to finish an assignment right before the deadline is extremely stressful. Additionally, if you start an assignment early and realize that you don’t know how to do a problem, not only do you have time to take a break and let yourself think about it for a bit and then come back to it, but you also have time to go to office hours. And, since you realized that you don’t know how to solve something early, office hours won’t be as crowded and you’ll get more individualized attention from the TAs. I can’t stress this piece of advice enough because not only will you have a better understanding of the material as well as higher grades, you will also be significantly less stress out than if you were to start an assignment the day before it’s due. 
    </p>

      <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Leave Your Door Open & Go to Club Meetings</h3>
    <p>I think that the best way to make friends is to leave your door open during the first few weeks of school and to go to club meetings for any club that you may have a slight interest in. I left my door open during the first week of school and a bunch of people in my dorm dropped in to introduce themselves. It was a great way to meet people because if someone’s door is open, someone passing by knows that the person inside wants to make friends, so it takes away the uncertainty of talking to someone not knowing if they really want to talk to anyone at the moment. It was also nice to have some familiar faces in the dorm and it made the transition to dorm life less scary. Additionally, I met one of my best friends because the room to her door was open so I went inside and started talking with her. I also think that going to club meetings is a good way to meet people because you automatically have something in common with everyone who is there. I joined a club that I ultimately didn’t end up liking, but I made a close friend through it so I am still glad that I joined.
